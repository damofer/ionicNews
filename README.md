# ionicNews

This is just a sample with Ionic + AngularJS

its a Simple News app that receives feeds via JSON file and Services (Noticias and Servicios tabs)


![Alt text] (/www/img/sample/Capture1.JPG "News")

All these feeds have been created by me , using a JSON file that its procesed in the controller just to being called after in a loop that shows all the news and events.

![Alt text] (/www/img/sample/Capture2.JPG "News")

Angular is a really powerfull framework, its capable of so many things, in this case i have a conditional switch that identifies if the feed is an event or a new, in case its an event, it will create a reservation button inside the section.

![Alt text] (/www/img/sample/Capture3.JPG "News")


from this point, i start using services.js file as the provider to full fill  the whole tab.
it works just like the json file.
